###Data File Import

Python program to import multiple files of attendees for GotoWebinar webinars and create 2 output files: 
one with a one row per attendee and one with one row per webinar

Program should read from multiple input files (all same format) and create just the 2 output files.  
Note that some of the input files are slightly different
 
In addtion to creating the output files, the program should load the output to a database.  
The program should create the tables if they don't exist or overwrite everything if they do exist.  
Table and Server names can be specified in a constant at the top of the file DB_NAME and SERVER_NAME
